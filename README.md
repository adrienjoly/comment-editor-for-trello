**Comment Editor by AJ** is designed for Trello users who also do a lot of structured note-taking.

It allows you to edit Trello card comments with the ease and comfort of a real note-taking application:

- a full-screen editor, for more focus / less distractions
- WYSIWYG Markdown editing
- outliner-like indentation of bullet points
- prevent you from accidentally aborting changes without saving
